<h1>About Python</h1>
<p>
  Python is one of those rare languages which can claim to be
  both&nbsp;<em>simple</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>powerful</em>. You will find
  yourself pleasantly surprised to see how easy it is to concentrate on the
  solution to the problem rather than the syntax and structure of the language
  you are programming in.
</p>
<p>The official introduction to Python is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient
    high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to
    object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing,
    together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for
    scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  I will discuss most of these features in more detail in the next section.
</p>
<h2>Story behind the name</h2>
<p>
  Guido van Rossum, the creator of the Python language, named the language after
  the BBC show "Monty Python's Flying Circus". He doesn't particularly like
  snakes that kill animals for food by winding their long bodies around them and
  crushing them.
</p>
<h2>Features of Python</h2>
<h3>Simple</h3>
<p>
  Python is a simple and minimalistic language. Reading a good Python program
  feels almost like reading English, although very strict English! This
  pseudo-code nature of Python is one of its greatest strengths. It allows you
  to concentrate on the solution to the problem rather than the language itself.
</p>
<h3>Easy to Learn</h3>
<p>
  As you will see, Python is extremely easy to get started with. Python has an
  extraordinarily simple syntax, as already mentioned.
</p>
<h3>Free and Open Source</h3>
<p>
  Python is an example of a&nbsp;<em>FLOSS</em>&nbsp;(Free/Libr√© and Open Source
  Software). In simple terms, you can freely distribute copies of this software,
  read its source code, make changes to it, and use pieces of it in new free
  programs. FLOSS is based on the concept of a community which shares knowledge.
  This is one of the reasons why Python is so good - it has been created and is
  constantly improved by a community who just want to see a better Python.
</p>
<h3>High-level Language</h3>
<p>
  When you write programs in Python, you never need to bother about the
  low-level details such as managing the memory used by your program, etc.
</p>
<h3>Portable</h3>
<p>
  Due to its open-source nature, Python has been ported to (i.e. changed to make
  it work on) many platforms. All your Python programs can work on any of these
  platforms without requiring any changes at all if you are careful enough to
  avoid any system-dependent features.
</p>
<p>
  You can use Python on GNU/Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, Macintosh, Solaris, OS/2,
  Amiga, AROS, AS/400, BeOS, OS/390, z/OS, Palm OS, QNX, VMS, Psion, Acorn RISC
  OS, VxWorks, PlayStation, Sharp Zaurus, Windows CE and PocketPC!
</p>
<p>
  You can even use a platform like&nbsp;<a
    href="http://kivy.org/"
    rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
    >Kivy</a
  >&nbsp;to create games for your computer&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;for iPhone,
  iPad, and Android.
</p>
<h3>Interpreted</h3>
<p>This requires a bit of explanation.</p>
<p>
  A program written in a compiled language like C or C++ is converted from the
  source language i.e. C or C++ into a language that is spoken by your computer
  (binary code i.e. 0s and 1s) using a compiler with various flags and options.
  When you run the program, the linker/loader software copies the program from
  hard disk to memory and starts running it.
</p>
<p>
  Python, on the other hand, does not need compilation to binary. You
  just&nbsp;<em>run</em>&nbsp;the program directly from the source code.
  Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called
  bytecodes and then translates this into the native language of your computer
  and then runs it. All this, actually, makes using Python much easier since you
  don't have to worry about compiling the program, making sure that the proper
  libraries are linked and loaded, etc. This also makes your Python programs
  much more portable, since you can just copy your Python program onto another
  computer and it just works!
</p>
<h3>Object Oriented</h3>
<p>
  Python supports procedure-oriented programming as well as object-oriented
  programming. In&nbsp;<em>procedure-oriented</em>&nbsp;languages, the program
  is built around procedures or functions which are nothing but reusable pieces
  of programs. In&nbsp;<em>object-oriented</em>&nbsp;languages, the program is
  built around objects which combine data and functionality. Python has a very
  powerful but simplistic way of doing OOP, especially when compared to big
  languages like C++ or Java.
</p>
<h3>Extensible</h3>
<p>
  If you need a critical piece of code to run very fast or want to have some
  piece of algorithm not to be open, you can code that part of your program in C
  or C++ and then use it from your Python program.
</p>
<h3>Embeddable</h3>
<p>
  You can embed Python within your C/C++ programs to
  give&nbsp;<em>scripting</em>&nbsp;capabilities for your program's users.
</p>
<h3>Extensive Libraries</h3>
<p>
  The Python Standard Library is huge indeed. It can help you do various things
  involving regular expressions,documentation generation, unit testing,
  threading, databases, web browsers, CGI, FTP, email, XML, XML-RPC, HTML, WAV
  files, cryptography, GUI (graphical user interfaces), and other
  system-dependent stuff. Remember, all this is always available wherever Python
  is installed. This is called the&nbsp;<em>Batteries Included</em
  >&nbsp;philosophy of Python.
</p>
<p>
  Besides the standard library, there are various other high-quality libraries
  which you can find at the&nbsp;<a
    href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi"
    rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
    >Python Package Index</a
  >.
</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
  Python is indeed an exciting and powerful language. It has the right
  combination of performance and features that make writing programs in Python
  both fun and easy.

<h2>Python 3 versus 2</h2>
<p>
  You can ignore this section if you're not interested in the difference between
  "Python version 2" and "Python version 3". But please do be aware of which
  version you are using. This book is written for Python version 3.
</p>
<p>
  Remember that once you have properly understood and learn to use one version,
  you can easily learn the differences and use the other one. The hard part is
  learning programming and understanding the basics of Python language itself.
  That is our goal in this book, and once you have achieved that goal, you can
  easily use Python 2 or Python 3 depending on your situation.

<h2>What Programmers Say</h2>
<p>
  You may find it interesting to read what great hackers like ESR have to say
  about Python:

      <em>Eric S. Raymond</em>&nbsp;is the author of "The Cathedral and the
      Bazaar" and is also the person who coined the term&nbsp;<em
        >Open Source</em

      >. This article was the real inspiration for my first brush with Python.

      <em>Bruce Eckel</em>&nbsp;is the author of the famous 'Thinking in Java'
      and 'Thinking in C++' books. He says that no language has made him more
      productive than Python. He says that Python is perhaps the only language
      that focuses on making things easier for the programmer. Read the&nbsp;<a

      >. He says that Python has always been an integral part of Google. You can
      actually verify this statement by looking at the&nbsp;<a
